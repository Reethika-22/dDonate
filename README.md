## Problem:
Today, most online donation systems rely on middlemen — platforms that charge high fees, delay fund transfers, and sometimes even risk fraud or misuse of funds. This lack of transparency makes donors uncertain about where their money truly goes.

## Solution:
That’s where TrustGive comes in.
Built on Algorand blockchain, TrustGive removes middlemen entirely.
Every donation is recorded transparently on-chain, so donors can track their funds in real time and ensure that they reach the right recipients.

---

## 💡 How It Works

Campaign Creation:
Verified organizations or individuals submit their donation campaigns.

Donor Connection:
Donors connect their Web3 wallet (like Pera Wallet) and send funds directly to the campaign’s smart contract.

Smart Contract Management:
The smart contract locks, manages, and releases funds only to verified recipients, based on predefined, verifiable conditions.

Transparent Tracking:
Every transaction is publicly visible on the blockchain, allowing donors to verify fund flow and impact themselves.

## 🌱 Our Mission

Our goal is simple — to restore trust in charitable giving through decentralization.

“Transparency is not optional — it’s the foundation of trust.”

## 🚀 What Makes D-Donate (TrustGive) Different

✅ No middlemen: Donations move directly from donor to recipient — no admin, no hidden fees.
✅ Transparent transactions: Every donation is stored immutably on the blockchain.
✅ Smart contracts for trust: Funds are only released when all conditions are met.
✅ Global access: Anyone, anywhere, with a crypto wallet can give or receive funds.
✅ Immutable ledger: Once recorded, donations cannot be altered or tampered with — ensuring complete trust.
