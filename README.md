🌐 TrustGive – Decentralizing Charity with Transparency and Trust

Problem:
Today, most online donation systems rely on middlemen — platforms that charge high fees, delay fund transfers, and sometimes even risk fraud or misuse of funds. This lack of transparency makes donors uncertain about where their money truly goes.

Solution:
That’s where TrustGive comes in.
Built on Algorand blockchain, TrustGive removes middlemen entirely.
Every donation is recorded transparently on-chain, so donors can track their funds in real time and ensure that they reach the right recipients.

💡 How It Works

Campaign Creation:
Verified organizations or individuals submit their donation campaigns.

Donor Connection:
Donors connect their Web3 wallet (like Pera Wallet) and send funds directly to the campaign’s smart contract.

Smart Contract Management:
The smart contract locks, manages, and releases funds only to verified recipients, based on predefined, verifiable conditions.

Transparent Tracking:
Every transaction is publicly visible on the blockchain, allowing donors to verify fund flow and impact themselves.

🌱 Our Mission

Our goal is simple — to restore trust in charitable giving through decentralization.

“Transparency is not optional — it’s the foundation of trust.”

🚀 What Makes D-Donate (TrustGive) Different

✅ No middlemen: Donations move directly from donor to recipient — no admin, no hidden fees.
✅ Transparent transactions: Every donation is stored immutably on the blockchain.
✅ Smart contracts for trust: Funds are only released when all conditions are met.
✅ Global access: Anyone, anywhere, with a crypto wallet can give or receive funds.
✅ Immutable ledger: Once recorded, donations cannot be altered or tampered with — ensuring complete trust.
